I played football in middle school. I won the title of quarterback. I cook for my family sometimes.I draw and sometimes study(I have never studied a day in my life, should I start?)
My favorite thing to do is eating.I love love love!! video games!!! ❤️.</p>
            			<h2><i>My talents/habits</i></h2>
<p>I like to sing in the shower. I have a habit of being mad for no reason. I have a habit of being loud for no reason.I can play volley ball. I could play professionaly, but I choose not to because it may be fun to win. But when  competition is involved, it's not fun to have pressure on you. Pressure leads to stress, Stress leads to sleep lost plus! Sleep lost leads to less activity, so you become lazy.</p>
