<h1>About me/myself/and I</h1>

<img src="loveable but not afraid to leave.jpg ">
<p>Hi,my nickname is cherry, it's a long story. I love food and clothes.
You might say I work well with <strong>people</strong>.
I'm more-so a coder and a actor, A highschooler. a daughter, a sister, a friend and a girl.
I'm not a bully, I'm socially awkward, I.Do.Not.Do.<strong>CROWDS</strong>.Ever. You might be wondering how I got the nickname, My bestfriend, Alex(her nickname) gave me that nickname, because when I was younger my face turned red when I got mad. She called me cherry, like the fruit. So that name is stuck to me forever. Another fact about me is I love Chocolate. specifically milk chocolate and mint chocolate chip.</p>

I played football in middle school. I won the title of quarterback. I cook for my family sometimes.I draw and sometimes study(I have never studied a day in my life, should I start?)
My favorite thing to do is eating.I love love love!!Video Games!!!❤️</p>
        <h2><i>My talents/habits</i></h2>
<p>I like to sing in the shower. I have a habit of being mad for no reason. I have a habit of being loud for no reason.I can play volley ball. I could play professionaly, but I choose not to because it may be fun to win. But when  competition is involved, it's not fun to have pressure on you. Pressure leads to stress. Now in some cases people use this stress as motivation.</p>
					<h2>My achievement</h2>

<p>I have made honor roll in my middle school, more than once. I have made the honor roll and principal list in HighSchool. I won the title of Quarter-Back in middle-school from the star Quarter-Back for the 7th grade and 8th. since the 6th grade didn't have one.
