<p>Hi,my nickname is cherry, it's a long story. I love food and clothes.
You might say I work well with <strong>people</strong>.
I'm more-so a coder and a actor, A highschooler. a daughter, a sister, a friend and a girl.
I'm not a bully, I'm socially awkward, I.Do.Not.Do.<strong>CROWDS</strong>.Ever. You might be wondering how I got the nickname, My bestfriend, Alex(her nickname) gave me that nickname, because when I was younger my face turned red when I got mad. She called me cherry, like the fruit. So that name is stuck to me forever. Another fact about me is I love Chocolate. specifically milk chocolate and mint chocolate chip. I'm a virgo, try to guess my birthday.</p>

<p>I have made honor roll in my middle school, more than once. I have made the honor roll and principal list in HighSchool. I won the title of Quarter-Back in middle-school from the star Quarter-Back for the 7th grade and 8th. since the 6th grade didn't have one.</p>

					<h2 id = "MyFears"><strong>My fears</strong></h2>
<div>
	<p>I'm scared of bugs and anything that flys(not butterflys nor birds). I'm scared of heights and tight places. I'm Claustrophobic. The small spiders that scare me, not tarantalas I love tarantalas. I hate bees, I hate them because 1) I'm allergic to them, like highly. 2) they fucking scare me with their big eyes and how they fly so smoothly into your face. oh, gives me chills just thinking about it. I don't like things that are slimly, like worms or slime. I like jello. I don't like being scared, if I get an extreme scare. I cry. No joke.</p>
