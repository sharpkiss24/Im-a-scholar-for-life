<p>Hi,my nickname is cherry, it's a long story. I love food and clothes.
You might say I work well with <strong>people</strong>.
I'm socially awkward, I.Do.Not.Do.<strong>CROWDS</strong>.Ever. You might be wondering how I got the nickname, My bestfriend, Alex(her nickname) gave me that nickname, because when I was younger my face turned red when I got mad (with my light skin self). She called me cherry, like the fruit because of my red face. So that name is stuck to me forever. Another fact about me is I love Chocolate specifically milk chocolate and mint chocolate chip. I'm a virgo, try to guess my birthday. fun fact i sleep better in cold rooms.</p>

<div>
	<p>I'm scared of bugs and anything that flys(not butterflys nor birds). I'm scared of heights and tight places. I'm Claustrophobic. The small spiders that scare me, not tarantalas I love tarantalas. I hate bees, I hate them because 1) they fucking scare me with their big eyes and how they fly so smoothly into your face. oh, gives me chills just thinking about it. I don't like being scared, if I get an extreme scare. I cry. No joke.</p>
