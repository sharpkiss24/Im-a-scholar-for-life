<h1>achievements</h1>
<p>I have made honor roll in my middle school, more than once. I have made the honor roll and principal list in HighSchool. I won the title of Quarter-Back in middle-school from the star Quarter-Back for the 7th grade and 8th. since the 6th grade didn't have one. I have progress from being that shy girl who hid in the shodows to this energetic and socially active and talkive girl. I have a bunch of friends to support me and friends from outside. I belong to a bunch of groups. I'm a friend, a lover, a sister, a daughter and most importantly a coder. all these things I thoight I would be but never a coder. but I guess life has a bunch of surprises.</p>
