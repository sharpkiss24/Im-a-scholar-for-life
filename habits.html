<h1>My talents/habits</h1>
<p>I like to sing in the shower. I have a habit of being mad for no reason. I have a habit of being loud for no reason.I can play volley ball.I have a habit of being a baby just because. I can dance when I want to. I can mimic other singer voices of my choice. I can eat food yet still be hungryI played football in middle school. I won the title of Quarter-Back. I cook for my family sometimes.I draw and sometimes study(I have never studied a day in my life, should I start?)
My favorite thing to do is eating.I love-love-love Video Games!!!❤️
we all,hate school. especially when it's back to school time. but during school time I become extremely lazy. Me vs other kids, they go to school everyday. Me as the school year goes on and on I miss more days, and I don't go back until the last day of school. </p>
